1. Review of Current Codebase and Dependencies
Dependencies (requirements.txt)
pocketflow: Lightweight, fine for orchestration.
youtube-transcript-api: Good for fetching transcripts, but fails if no transcript is available (no fallback to ASR).
jinja2: Good for templating HTML.
Code Review Highlights
Transcript Extraction:
Uses youtube-transcript-api, which is fast if a transcript exists, but fails or is slow for videos without transcripts.
No fallback to audio-based transcription (e.g., Whisper).
LLM Calls:
All topic extraction, Q&A, and simplification are done sequentially, with a separate LLM call for each topic and Q&A pair.
No batching or parallelization.
HTML Generation:
Efficient, not a bottleneck.
Error Handling:
Good, but flow continues even if transcript is empty (wastes LLM calls).
2. Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
LLM Calls:
Each topic and Q&A is processed in a loop, causing many sequential LLM calls. This is the main source of slowness.
Transcript Extraction:
No fallback to ASR (e.g., Whisper) for videos without transcripts.
No Parallelization:
All steps are strictly sequential.
No Caching:
Repeated runs on the same video re-do all work.
3. Proposal for a Faster, More Robust System
 review proposal.md
4. Implementation Sketch
TranscriptNode:
Try youtube-transcript-api.
If fails, download audio and run Whisper.
Cache result.
TopicExtractionNode:
Extract all topics in one LLM call.
QAGenerationNode:
Batch all Q&A prompts and run in parallel.
SimplifyNode:
Batch all simplification prompts and run in parallel.
HTMLGenerationNode:
No change needed.
5. Benefits
Much faster: Parallel and batched LLM calls.
More robust: Handles videos without transcripts.
Scalable: Can process multiple videos in parallel in the future.
6. Next Steps
Add Whisper dependency and implement ASR fallback.
Refactor nodes to batch and parallelize LLM calls.
Add caching for transcripts and LLM outputs.
Test and benchmark performance.
